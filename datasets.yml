  queries:

    - id: countries-with-airports
      name: Countries With Airports
      challenge: |-
        Find the 10 countries with the most airports. Include the name of the country and the number of airports.
      points: 5
      query: |-
        SELECT country, count(country) AS count
        FROM airport
        GROUP BY country
        ORDER BY count DESC
        LIMIT 10
      hints:
        - You'll need to use a GROUP BY.

    - id: uk-airports
      name: UK Airports
      challenge: |-
        Find the names of all airports in the UK, in alphabetical order.
      points: 10
      query: |-
        SELECT RAW airportname FROM airport
        WHERE country = "United Kingdom"
        AND airportname NOT IN ["London St Pancras", "Waterloo International", "All Airports"]
        AND airportname NOT LIKE "%Station"
        ORDER BY airportname
      hints:
        - The question asks for just the airport name - you may need to use SELECT RAW.
        - The data is messy and includes some railway stations as well as airports.
        - '"All Airports" is not an airport.'

    - id: london-hotels
      name: Best London Hotels
      challenge: |-
        Find all hotels in London, in order of average overall rating (across all reviews for that hotel), highest to
        lowest. Include the name of the hotel and the average overall rating, leaving hotels with no reviews at the end.
        If multiple hotels have the same average rating, return them in alphabetical order.
      points: 15
      query: |-
        SELECT name, ARRAY_AVG(ARRAY r.ratings.Overall FOR r IN t.reviews END) AS ratings_overall
        FROM hotel AS t
        WHERE t.city = "London"
        ORDER BY ratings_overall DESC NULLS LAST, name
      hints:
        - You could use either the AVG function with a subquery, or the ARRAY_AVG function with an array range transformation expression.
        - ORDER BY takes a parameter to control where null values get placed in the sort order.

    - id: late-fliers
      name: Late Fliers
      challenge: |-
        Find the names of all the cities that can be reached from San Francisco Airport on flights scheduled to depart
        between 10pm and 6am (Pacific Time), in alphabetical order. Ensure each city only appears once.
      points: 20
      query: |-
        SELECT RAW a.city
        FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route r
        JOIN `travel-sample`.inventory.airport a ON r.destinationairport = a.faa
        WHERE r.sourceairport = "SFO"
        AND ARRAY_LENGTH((
          SELECT s.*
          FROM r.schedule s
          WHERE s.utc >= "05:00:00"
          AND s.utc < "13:00:00"
          ORDER BY s.utc)) > 0
        GROUP BY a.city
        ORDER BY a.city
      hints:
        - 10pm and 6am Pacific Time are 05:00 and 13:00 UTC respectively.
        - San Francisco Airport's FAA/ICAO code is SFO.
        - This is doable with one JOIN and one ARRAY_LENGTH subquery - you can filter on `route.sourceairport` to narrow down the list of routes to consider.

    - id: departure-board
      name: Departure Board
      challenge: |-
        Find the departure time and IATA code of the destination airport of the next 25 flights departing from London Heathrow.
        If two flights depart at the same time, sort them by the destination airport code.
      points: 25
      query: |-
        select s.utc, r.destinationairport from route r
        unnest r.schedule s
        where r.sourceairport = "LHR"
        and s.day = date_part_str(now_utc(), "dow")
        and s.utc > NOW_STR("hh:mm:ss")
        order by s.utc, r.destinationairport
        limit 25

      name: Tram Lines
      challenge: |-
        Find the details of all tram lines, ordered by the route ID.

      query: |-
        SELECT RAW r FROM routes r WHERE r.agency_id = "METL" AND route_short_name NOT LIKE "%Bus Replacement" ORDER BY r.route_id
      hints:
        - The data contains tram replacement buses - you'll need to exclude these.
        - The Metrolink agency ID is METL.

    - id: departure-board
      name: Take Me Home, Metrolink
      challenge: |-
        Find the next 10 departures from the three closest tram stops to the Couchbase Manchester office (as the crow flies from the front door).
        Include the departure time, stop name, and destination of the tram. Order by departure time.

          JOIN trips ON trips.trip_id = stop_times.trip_id

          AND stop_times.arrival_time < MILLIS_TO_STR(NOW_MILLIS() + 15 * 60 * 1000, "hh:mm:ss")

          AND (stops.stop_name LIKE "Piccadilly%"
            OR stops.stop_name LIKE "Market Street%")
          AND stops.stop_name LIKE "%Metrolink)"
        ORDER BY stop_times.arrival_time
        LIMIT 10
      hints:
        - "The three closest stops are Piccadilly Gardens, Market Street, and Piccadilly."
        - You may need to use at least two JOIN statements.
        - The dataset includes separate schedules for Mondays-Fridays and Saturdays-Sundays. Make sure you use the right one.

      challenge: |-
        Find the average number of races per year. Return just the number (no object wrapping it).

      query: |-
        with years as (select year, count(year) as count from _default group by year)
        select raw avg(years.count) from years
      hints:
        - Trying to do "SELECT AVG(COUNT(...))" won't work - consider a common table expression or subquery.

    - id: ricciardo-last
      name: Danny Ric's Last Win
      challenge: |-
        Find the date of the last race that Daniel Ricciardo won.
      points: 15
      query: |-
        SELECT RAW r.date FROM _default r
        WHERE ANY res IN r.results SATISFIES res.driver.DriverRef = "ricciardo" AND res.position = 1 END
        ORDER BY r.date DESC
        LIMIT 1

    - id: last-winners
      name: Race Winners
      challenge: |-
        Find the names of the last 10 people to win a F1 race, along with the date of the last race they won, latest to oldest.
      points: 20
      query: |-
        SELECT winner, MAX(r.date) AS date FROM _default r
        LET winner = FIRST res.driver.Forename || " " || res.driver.Surname FOR res IN r.results WHEN res.position = 1 END
        WHERE ARRAY_LENGTH(r.results) > 0
        GROUP BY winner
        ORDER BY date desc
        LIMIT 10
      hints:
        - To get the driver's full name, use `r.driver.Forename || " " || r.driver.Surname` (where `r` is your collection alias).
        - The dataset includes records for races that haven't happened yet, and thus have no results. You'll need to filter those out.
        - The question asks for the last 10 people, not the last 10 races - you'll need to use a GROUP BY.

    - id: monza-record
      name: Monza Lap Record
      challenge: |-
        Find the fastest lap ever done around the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza, along with the date of the race and the surname of the driver to set it.
        Return the lap time in the format "<m>m<s>s.<ms>", where <m/s/ms> are the minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
      points: 20
      query: |-
        select l.driver.Surname as surname, duration_to_str(l.time_millis * 1000 * 1000) as time, r.date from _default r
        unnest array_flatten(r.lap_times, 1) l
        where r.circuit.circuitRef = "monza"
        order by l.time_millis
        limit 1
      hints:
        - The lap_times field is structured as a nested array, where each outer array is one lap and each object in the inner array is one driver's time.
        - The ARRAY_FLATTEN function in conjunction with UNNEST may be useful.
        - ORDER BY time might not work right because N1QL sorts alphabetically, try time_millis instead.
        - The DURATION_TO_STR function will output the duration in the right format automatically, though pay attention to the units.

    - id: commentator-last-races
      name: Driver to Commentator
      challenge: |-
        Find the date of the last race of each of Sky Sports F1's commentators
        (David Croft, Martin Brundle, Paul di Resta, Ted Kravitz, Anthony Davidson, Karun Chandhok, Johnny Herbert,
        Damon Hill, Jenson Button, Nico Rosberg), in alphabetical order of their first names.
      points: 30
      query: |-
        SELECT name,
               MAX(d.date) AS date
        FROM _default d
        UNNEST d.results r
        LET name = (r.driver.Forename || " " || r.driver.Surname)
        WHERE name IN ["Martin Brundle", "Paul di Resta", "Anthony Davidson", "Karun Chandhok", "Johnny Herbert", "Damon Hill", "Jenson Button", "Nico Rosberg"]
        GROUP BY name
        ORDER BY name
      hints:
        - Not all of the commentators have actually driven in F1.
        - UNNEST may be helpful.
        - You can use `WHERE name IN ["foo", "bar"]` to avoid having to write 10 WHERE/AND clauses.
